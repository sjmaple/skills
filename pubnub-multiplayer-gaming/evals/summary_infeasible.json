Testing Swift or Kotlin platform-specific PubNub initialization would require Xcode, Android Studio, or native compilers which are not available in the sandbox environment. The mobile-specific configuration patterns (heartbeatInterval, presenceTimeout) are already tested in the JavaScript scenarios."

This requires running multiple concurrent PubNub-connected clients, live network connections, and network simulation tooling. The eval sandbox has no PubNub keys, no ability to run multiple concurrent processes, and no network simulation infrastructure."
